### Global State Management

In order to manage global state without adding any extra dependencies, the app makes use of the ContextAPI.
First, the App component (the higher level one) fetchs all the necessary data and sets several states:

Then, two objects are created holding these states: sessionData and coinsData, the first one keeps the user session data, such as the username, the unique hexacode used for sending transactions and so. The second one holds all data related to the current prices of different cryptos (provided by coinGECKO) and the unique wallet of the logged user. The objects are passed as values of the context Providers.

In order to make use of the context, we took advantage of the destructuring syntax of javascript.

### Styling and Responsiveness

The app's design system is based on TailwindCSS, it's fully responsive and should render properly on all devices.
